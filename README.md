# UnityRandomObjectPlacer
This script places prefabs randomly within a cube.

Place in Project/Editor
The tool is accessible under the Tools menu.
The Object to Clone should be set to your prefab you want to clone.
The Target Cube is a cube that has been expanded and moved around to wherever.
The Object Count is how many of the object you want - currently, it's set to fit in a range of 1-100, because that fits my use case.
